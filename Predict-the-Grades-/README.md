### Project Overview

 This project is to predict the basic grades of school students  by  using some of its  unique features of students marks , behaviour ets .  Its accuracy result is done by using a machine learning algorithm i.e Random Classifier .  Prediction is done by using the algorithm 


### Learnings from the project

 The project had shown me the qualities of using machine learning algorithm .  Since ,  Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for  regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes  or mean prediction (regression) of the  individual trees
